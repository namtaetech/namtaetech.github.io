- name: Configure Elk VM with Docker
  hosts: elkservers
  remote_user: sysadmin
  become: true
  tasks:
    # Use apt module -- docker.io container
    - name: Install containerd
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        name: containerd
        state: present
    - name: Install docker.io
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present
      # Use apt module -- python
    - name: Install pip3
      apt:
        force_apt_get: yes
        name: python3-pip
        state: present
      # Use pip module -- docker
    - name: Install Docker python module
      pip:
        name: docker
        state: present
      # start docker
    - name: start docker

        enabled: yes
      # Use command module

      command: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
      # Use sysctl module
    - name: Use more memory
      sysctl:
        name: vm.max_map_count
        value: "262144"
        state: present
        reload: yes
      # Use docker_container module -- setup port
    - name: download and launch a docker elk container
      docker_container:

        image: sebp/elk:761
        state: started
        restart_policy: always
        published_ports:
