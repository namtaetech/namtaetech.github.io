This week I'm gonna go over how did I create a VPN network without open a port at the client side.

<p>Or you can access the document with this link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jAg0QPvp_RnDkEx8TYvUsjHqn5MNsGsM12Qo8FqPEqc/edit?usp=sharing</p>
<br>
We need a VPS running in order to use free OpenVPN access server for free
<br>
I’m using Digital Ocean 
<br>
Setting up VPN server access on VPS 
<br>
Create droplet 
<br>
Select VPN server Access
<br>


Add ssh key to connect the server without putting in password, but if you don’t put in Digital Ocean will email use a root password and you can change it later
<br>
Then you will have something like this
<br>
Log in to your terminal with the IP address given (this will be IP of your VPS)
<br>
Login using ssh cmd
<br>
<code>
$ ssh root@IP_address_of_your_server
</code>
Ex.			$ ssh root@157.245.129.45

After logging in, it will have you setup the service 
<code>Say YES on the accept agreement </code>
Then you can just press <code>ENTER</code> for default setting
<br>
	    
        Reset your root password by <br>
	    <code>$ passwd root</code>
		It will ask you to put a new password
<br>
Reset OpenVPN account by
        
        $ passwd openvpn 
        
To log in on GUI interface of OpenVPN server/client 
Admin:		https:// IP address of your VPS server:943/admin
https://157.245.129.45:943/admin

	At username put	“openvpn”
	At password put 	“your password that your recreate”
by using cmd $passwd openvpn earlier


Troubleshooting 
		If the GUI OpenVPN is not run
		Run 		$ /usr/local/openvpn_as/bin/ovpn-init
		Then put	DELETE

Setting up users 

    Go under “user management” at the tool menu on the left of the page 
    Then select “user permission” 

For Regular users 

    Enter new username in the “new username” box
    Then check on Allow Auto-login box, so we don’t need to put in password 
    Then click at more settings to enter password to login and get the client file and leave everything as default 

For Gateway users

    Follow the same steps as user but change a couple setting 
    And follow the setting down below

At VPN gateway the address that we put is the address of your private network that you connect this client gateway to 

Running the server
After setup all the user
We will download config file by logging in at
	Client:		https:// IP address of your VPS server:943/
https://157.245.129.45:943/

	Put in your username and password that we create in user management 



After login download config file at the button “Yourself (auto-login profile) if you set as auto-login in the setting. If not the GUI interface have option for you


Run the config file 
*make sure on the machine have openvpn software
			$ sudo apt-get install openvpn 
Using the cmd 
			$ openvpn --config /location_of_yourfile/ name_of_the_config file
Ex. 			$ openvpn --config /home/pi/openvpn/client.ovpn
