Reverse SSH is similar to regular SSH but it is a technique through which you can access systems that are behind a firewall from the outside world.

My server machine is 192.168.1.166
My client machine is 192.168.1.126


At server machine 
Create public key
    <code>$ ssh-keygen </code>
- enter all the way thru to use default setting
- The location of the file is /root/.ssh -> id_rsa.pub

    <code>$ cd /root/.ssh</code>
    <code>$ ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub user@client_ip_addree </code>


*make sure open port for communication 22 and selected port
*make sure the raspberry run openssh-server
	
Check file /etc/ssh/sshd_config on 
AllowAgentForwarding yes
AllowTcpForwarding yes
GatewayPorts yes
X11Forwarding yes 

Open a port on your router to have 22 direct to server machine 
Go on your router setting 


At client Machine
Using
    <code>$ ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 user@IP_addr_server (or Public IP) </code>

At	2222	- is a port as your desire but make sure at the server you also open this port on the machine 
At 	22	- we usually not change because we are using this port for ssh
At 	user	- is the user of the machine that you want to ssh to
  


After setting 
At the server machine 
Using cmd 
    <code>$ ssh -l pi -p 2222 localhost </code>
At	pi	- is the user of client (126) 
At	2222	- is the port that you set to have reverse tunnel going thru
