Reverse SSH is similar to regular SSH but it is a technique through which you can access systems that are behind a firewall from the outside world.

<h1>1. At server machine (Raspberry Pi)</h1>
<p>Create public key <code>$ ssh-keygen </code></p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter all the way thru to use default setting</li>
    <li>The location of the file is <code>/root/.ssh</code></li>
</ul>
<p> After create ssh-key on the Raspberry Pi or Server, we need to copy the key and provide to client machine by using ssh-copy-id method </p>

$ ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub user@client_ip_addree

<ul>
    <li>make sure open port for communication 22 and selected port</li>
    <li>make sure the raspberry run openssh-server</li>
</ul>
<p> We can check the the config file of ssh by navigate to  
    Check file <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> and make sure the config look like down below </p>
<ul>
    <li>AllowAgentForwarding yes</li>
    <li>AllowTcpForwarding yes </li>
    <li>GatewayPorts yes</li>
    <li>X11Forwarding yes </li>
</ul>

<p>Open a port on your router to have 22 direct to server machine by go to your router setting</p>



<h1>2. At client Machine</h1>
<p> Making the connecting to Server Machine </p>

$ ssh -R 2222:localhost:22 user@server_ip_addr

<ul>    
    <li>At <code>server_ip_address</code> 
    - if it's the same network, you can you the <code>private IP Address</code>
    - if it's not in the same network, we are using <code>public IP address</code> </li>
    <li>At	<code>2222</code>	- is a port as your desire but make sure at the server you also open this port on the machine</li>
    <li>At 	<code>22</code>	- we usually not change because we are using this port for ssh</li>
    <li>At 	<code>user</code>	- is the user of the machine that you want to ssh to</li>
</ul>
<h1>After setting </h1>
<h2>At the server machine </h2>
<p>Type in <code>$ ssh -l pi -p 2222 localhost </code> </p>
<ul>
    <li>At	<code>pi</code>	- is the user of client</li> 
    <li>At	<code>2222</code>	- is the port that you set to have reverse tunnel going thru </li>
</ul>
