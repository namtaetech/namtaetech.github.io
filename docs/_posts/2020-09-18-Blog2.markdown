    <p>Penetration is the offensive security practice of attacking a network using the same techniques that a hacker would use, in an effort to identify security holes and raise awareness in an organization. The scope and purpose of an engagement is need to be discussed before the penetration test in pre-engagement interaction between organization and the pen testing team.</p>
    <h3>An engagement consists of 5 stages</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Active and Passive reconnaissance</li>
            <p> This stage is the first step that we are gathering information about the target. </p>
        <li>Scanning enumeration</li>
            <p> This stage is the second step that we are scannning network to find vulnerabilities.</p>
        <li>Gaining access</li>
            <p> After we found posible way to get in we start gaining access through exploitation </p>
        <li>Maintaining your access</li>
            <p> After we are able to gain access we need to maintaine the access to be ale have long duration in the affected system in order to steal sensitive information or spead insode the network by the vulnerabilty is used as a persisten presence.</p>
        <li>Covering your tracks</li>
            <p>After we are able to gain access we need to cover our track, so the target will not be able to kick us out of the system and patch the hole.</p>
    </ol>

    <h3>Type of Penetration Testing </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Black Box - testing similar to black hat hacker, who has no prio knowledge of the target system and network.</li>
        <li>White Box - penetration testers are given full knowledge of the system or network. This knowledge allows them to tear apart subtke security issues on behalf of their client.</li>
        <li>Grey Box - testing preformed by the in-house system or network administrator. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Legal Disclaimer</h4>
    <p>Gathering information about a person or organization using the public domain is legal. Attempting to gain access to systems that do not belong to you or you do not have permission to access is illegal, and a potential felony. For example, performing any of the following acts without the specific, written permission of the system's owner would be considered a felony: Port scans, Brute force attacks,Social engineering.</p>
