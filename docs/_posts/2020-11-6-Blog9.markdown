<p>Hello, from my CIT 484 class (Web Development) one of our assignment is to create a calculator that calculate the total price of a products.</p>

<p>The program will take the input of </p>
<ul>
    <li>Price per unit</li>
    <li>Quauntity</li>
    <li>Tax Rate</li>
    <li>Discount</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the program should calculate the total price</p>

<p>In our class we were using JSBin which is a web-based program that any user can write a code in HTML, CSS and JavaScript in 1 window and it is giving the output right away while the user is writing the code.</p>
<p>Here check out my code here</p>
